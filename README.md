The repository consists of the following files:
1. __`Homework_4_1.ipynb`__: 
     > A Jupyter notebook of the first point about house clustering
2. __`Homework_4_2.ipynb`__: 
     > A Jupyter notebook of the second point about hashing

Instead the folders "data" contains the features and the description foreach announcement and "wordcloud" contains the png images of the wordcloud.
